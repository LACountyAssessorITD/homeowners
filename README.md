## To Run this Website
1.	Download this project
2.	Place it in the inetpub/wwwroot/
3.	In constants make sure ON_AZURE is correctly set to true or false
4.	Make sure the necessary Databases homeowner_test and HOX_USC are in the MS SQL Database as well as the tables (if they arenâ€™t execute the SQL scripts in the SQL_NEW folder)
5.	Make sure in temp_table you add all the users with their level of permissions
6.	Go to http://localhost/homeowners/index.php in your preferred browser and you are ready to start using the website

NOTES:
1.	Any value of 0 is assumed to be NULL by PHP
2.	When using advanced search there is a discrepancy with the state field (uses CA instead of California)
3.	Create_claim_page.php should only be used for inputting data ONCE, after that you should update the claim through claim_page.php
4.
